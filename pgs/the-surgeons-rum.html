                <h2>Creating a neo-vintage brand</h2>
                <p class="case-subtitle">To bring a brand to life, a designer needs to involve the client and their vision. In this project, I created a brand identity with neo-Victorian aesthetics.</p>

                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>A brand is a name, as much as it is a visual identity. It should convey a sense of uniqueness; tie in with company values. And worn like a name, it should stand on its own merits and be recognised at a glance. In a sense, a brand is like a living entity.</p>
                <p>But identities don't just emerge overnight; as it is with people, there is a degree of exploration, interpretation, reflection, and reiteration required.</p>
                <p>Such was the case when I was approached by <span class="company-name">The Surgeons Rum</span>, and presented an opportunity to bring to life, and shape, their brand. I was asked to design and develop a colour palette, logo, and bottle cap that would resonate a Victorian influence and incorporate a medical reference.</p>

              <h5>Approach</h5>
                <p><span class="company-name">The Surgeons Rum</span> planned to target their products at an upper, middle-class, male audience. In addition to &lsquo;vintageness&rsquo;, the product had to project a sense of class, quality, and masculinity. To better understand these characteristics, and how I might be able to communicate them, I decided to research the style of the Victorian era, as well as modern-day depictions of it.</p> 
                <p>To broaden my source of inspiration, I took into consideration men&rsquo;s clothing, medical tools, colours, bottle designs, seals, and labels from the 19th century.</p>
                <p>Once I had an idea of what made this period stylistically unique, I intended to emulate it across my designs. To ensure that I met the client&rsquo;s needs, I made sure to consider feedback and direction at the end of each design cycle.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-box">
                <h5>Process</h5>
                <p>The client and I explored different compositions, Victorian iconography, and embellishment styles. At the end of each reiterative process, the client&rsquo;s feedback influenced the direction and ideas I incorporated.</p> 
                <p>The final design emerged through combining 2D representations of a wax seal, human skull, and surgical scissors.</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                  <img src="../img/portfolio/surgeons-rum/development.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Design and development of the logo." title="The evolutionary tree that led to the final design.">
                </div>
                <p>I proposed using Stowe Open Face for the font because it gave the logo a sense of symmetry. Most of the other Victorian fonts that were considered drastically shifted the perception of this. The skull design also matched the character map dimensions very well.</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                  <img src="../img/portfolio/surgeons-rum/font.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Example of Stowe Open Face" title="A sample character map for Stowe Open Face.">
                </div>
                <p>Across my observations, I found that neo-Victorian aesthetics incorporated dark varieties of navy blue, white, black, and brown. This colour palette resonated with my client; the final colour scheme was a saturated derivative inspired by <abbr title="2010 TV Series" class="initialism">Sherlock</abbr>.</p>

                  <img src="../img/portfolio/surgeons-rum/palette.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Initial colour palette" title="An example of the neo-Victorian colour palette used in Sherlock.">
                </div>
                <p>The client and I explored different coloured renders of the logo and bottle cap. For the final design, the brand name and skull were emphasised through the use of contrast.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="text-box">
                <h5>Outcome</h5>
                <p>The client was pleased with the final design; it now represents the brand on social media and will feature on future packaging.</p>
